Freeze-casting is a processing route for producing materials of anisotropic porosity in the form of aligned and well-defined microchannels. In freeze-casting, particulates of a material are suspended in a fluid and a thermal gradient is applied across for directional freezing. Controlling the thermal gradient across the suspension amounts to controlling the kinetics and freezing direction in the suspension and thus the resulting structural features and dimensions of the microchannels. The performance of the device presented here was evaluated by directional freezing of both water and aqueous ceramic suspension samples using both linear and exponential freezing profiles. The freezing front was successfully tracked by continuously measuring the temperature gradient along the sample using thermocouples directly mounted on the freeze-casting mold. The current minimum operational temperature of the freeze-caster is \u223c220 K, with freezing front velocities in the range of \u223c5 \u03bcm/s to 30 \u03bcm/s for sample lengths of 5 mm\u201325 mm.</jats:p>",

Here, we propose that correlated electron\u2013hole pair tunneling can occur at room temperature in a monolithic multilayer WSe2 device with bottom Au contacts. Electron and hole conducting channels separated by an intrinsic, insulating region in the center of the crystal are defined by doping. The monolithic vertical homojunction formed naturally in the bulk vdW crystal provides a defect-free interface structure which shows clear indications of correlated tunneling at room temperature. We interpret zero-bias peaks in the differential conductance curves as a signature of electron\u2013hole pairing when their densities balance. The conductance peak vanishes when the electron and hole densities are unbalanced, which can be controlled by the external electrical field, magnetic field, or temperature.

The radio detection method, utilizing Askaryan emission, can be used to detect these neutrinos in polar ice. The propagation of the radio pulses has to be modeled carefully to reconstruct the energy, direction, and flavor of the neutrino from the detected radio flashes. Here, we study the effect of birefringence in ice, which splits up the radio pulse into two orthogonal polarization components with slightly different propagation speeds. This provides useful signatures to determine the neutrino energy and is potentially important to determine the neutrino direction to degree precision. We calculated the effect of birefringence from first principles where the only free parameter is the dielectric tensor as a function of position. Our code, for the first time, can propagate full RF waveforms, taking interference due to changing polarization eigenvectors during propagation into account. The model is available open-source through the NuRadioMC framework. We compare our results to in-situ calibration data from the ARA and ARIANNA experiments and find good agreement for the available time delay measurements. This indicates a significant improvement of the prediction power of birefringence effects compared to previous models.

Due to their extremely short lifetimes, magnetars should follow the demographics of galaxies according to their current star formation rate (SFR).

We construct a simple model for the host galaxies of magnetars assuming these events track SFR in all galaxies and compare it to observed properties from a sample of 10 secure FRB hosts. We find the distribution of observed SFRs is inconsistent with the model at &gt;95% c.l. The offset distribution is consistent with this scenario; however, this could be due to the limited sample size and the seeing-limited estimates for the effective radii of the FRB host galaxies. Despite the recent association of an FRB with a magnetar in the Milky Way, magnetars may not be the only source of FRBs in the universe, yet any other successful model must account for the demographics of the FRB host in SFR and their observed galactocentric offsets.</jats:p>\n<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>The H <jats:sc>i</jats:sc> gas content is a key ingredient in galaxy evolution, the study of which has been limited to moderate cosmological distances for individual galaxies due to the weakness of the hyperfine H <jats:sc>i</jats:sc> 21 cm transition.

This bias arises as an effect of the magnitude and colour criteria utilized in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasar target selection up until data release 7 (DR7). The bias has previously been quantified assuming only a contribution from the dust obscuration. In this work, we apply the full set of magnitude and colour criteria used up until SDSS-DR7 in order to quantify the full impact of dust biasing against dusty and metal-rich DLAs. We apply the quasar target selection algorithm on a modelled population of intrinsic colours, and by exploring the parameter space consisting of redshift, ($z_{\\rm{\\small QSO}}$and zabs), optical extinction, and H\u2009i column density, we demonstrate how the selection probability depends on these variables. We quantify the dust bias on the following properties derived for DLAs at z\u00a0\u2248\u00a03: the incidence rate, the mass density of neutral hydrogen and metals, and the average metallicity. We find that all quantities are significantly affected. When considering all uncertainties, the mass density of neutral hydrogen is underestimated by 10\u201350\u00a0per\u2009cent, and the mass density in metals is underestimated by 30\u2013200\u00a0per\u2009cent. Lastly, we find that the bias depends on redshift. At redshift z\u00a0=\u00a02.2, the mass density of neutral hydrogen and metals might be underestimated by up to a factor of 2 and 5, respectively.

Recently, using observations and reanalysis products, the central Indian Ocean (CIO) mode was found to be a natural mode in the ocean\u2010atmosphere coupled system and also shown to have a close mechanistic connection with the monsoon intraseasonal oscillation (MISO). In this study, the simulation of the actual CIO mode in historical Community Earth System Model (CESM) outputs is assessed by comparing with observations and reanalysis products. The simulation of the Madden\u2010Julian Oscillation, a major component of tropical intraseasonal variabilities (ISVs), is satisfactory. However, the CIO mode is not well captured in any of the CESM simulations considered here. The force and response relationship between the atmosphere and the ocean associated with the CIO mode in CESM is opposite to that in nature. The simulated meridional gradient of large\u2010scale zonal winds is too weak, which precludes the necessary energy conversion from the mean state to the ISVs and cuts off the energy source to MISO in CESM. The inability of CESM to reproduce the CIO mode seen clearly in nature highlights the CIO mode as a new dynamical framework for diagnosing the deficiencies in Indian summer monsoon simulation in climate models. The CIO mode is a coupled metric for evaluating climate models and may be a better indicator of a model's skill to accurately capture the tropical multiscale interactions over subseasonal to interannual timescales.</jats:p>\n<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Tropical sea surface temperature (SST) biases can cause atmospheric biases on global scales, hence SST needs to be represented well in climate models. A major source of uncertainties is the representation of turbulent mixing in the oceanic boundary layer, or mixed layer (ML). In the present study we focus on near\u2010inertial wave (NIW) induced mixing. The performance of two mixing schemes, Turbulent Kinetic Energy and K\u2010profile parameterization (KPP), is assessed at two sites (11.5\u00b0N, 23\u00b0W and 15\u00b0N, 38\u00b0W) in the tropical Atlantic. At 11.5\u00b0N, turbulence observations (eddy diffusivities, shear and stratification) are available for comparison. We find that the schemes differ in their representation of NIWs, but both under\u2010represent the observed enhanced diffusivities below the observed ML. However, we find that the models do mix below the ML at 15\u00b0N when a storm passes nearby. The near\u2010inertial oscillations remain below the ML for the following 10\u00a0days. Near\u2010inertial kinetic energy (NIKE) biases in the models are not directly correlated with the wind speed, the MLD biases, or the stratification at the ML base. Instead, NIKE biases are sensitive to the vertical mixing scheme parameterization. NIKE biases are lowest when the KPP scheme is used.</jats:p>\n<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Prediction and Research Moored Array in the Tropical Atlantic (PIRATA) is a multinational program initiated in 1997 in the tropical Atlantic to improve our understanding and ability to predict ocean\u2010atmosphere variability.

We term this noise \u201cthermal intermodulation noise\u201d and show that for a resonant laser probe it manifests as intensity fluctuations. We report and characterize thermal intermodulation noise in an optomechanical cavity, where the frequency fluctuations are caused by mechanical Brownian motion, and find excellent agreement with our developed theoretical model. We demonstrate that the effect is particularly relevant to quantum optomechanics: using a phononic crystal <jats:inline-formula>\n\t    \n\t  </jats:inline-formula> membrane with a low-mass, soft-clamped mechanical mode, we are able to operate in the regime where measurement quantum backaction contributes as much force noise as the thermal environment does.

The radio detection method, utilizing Askaryan emission, can be used to detect these neutrinos in polar ice. The propagation of the radio pulses has to be modeled carefully to reconstruct the energy, direction, and flavor of the neutrino from the detected radio flashes. Here, we study the effect of birefringence in ice, which splits up the radio pulse into two orthogonal polarization components with slightly different propagation speeds. This provides useful signatures to determine the neutrino energy and is potentially important to determine the neutrino direction to degree precision. We calculated the effect of birefringence from first principles where the only free parameter is the dielectric tensor as a function of position. Our code, for the first time, can propagate full RF waveforms, taking interference due to changing polarization eigenvectors during propagation into account. The model is available open-source through the NuRadioMC framework. We compare our results to in-situ calibration data from the ARA and ARIANNA experiments and find good agreement for the available time delay measurements. This indicates a significant improvement of the prediction power of birefringence effects compared to previous models.

Magnetars are neutron stars with strong magnetic fields on the order of 10<jats:sup>15</jats:sup> G with a short decay lifetime of less than 10<jats:sup>4</jats:sup> yr. Due to their extremely short lifetimes, magnetars should follow the demographics of galaxies according to their current star formation rate (SFR). Moreover, we hypothesize that magnetars should follow the SFR profile within galaxies, which we assume to follow an exponential profile. We construct a simple model for the host galaxies of magnetars assuming these events track SFR in all galaxies and compare it to observed properties from a sample of 10 secure FRB hosts. We find the distribution of observed SFRs is inconsistent with the model at &gt;95% c.l. The offset distribution is consistent with this scenario; however, this could be due to the limited sample size and the seeing-limited estimates for the effective radii of the FRB host galaxies. Despite the recent association of an FRB with a magnetar in the Milky Way, magnetars may not be the only source of FRBs in the universe, yet any other successful model must account for the demographics of the FRB host in SFR and their observed galactocentric offsets.</jats:p>\n<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>The H <jats:sc>i</jats:sc> gas content is a key ingredient in galaxy evolution, the study of which has been limited to moderate cosmological distances for individual galaxies due to the weakness of the hyperfine H <jats:sc>i</jats:sc> 21 cm transition.

By compiling recent [C <jats:sc>ii</jats:sc>]-158 <jats:italic>\u03bc</jats:italic>m emission line measurements we quantify the evolution of the H <jats:sc>i</jats:sc> content in galaxies through cosmic time.

This bias arises as an effect of the magnitude and colour criteria utilized in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasar target selection up until data release 7 (DR7). The bias has previously been quantified assuming only a contribution from the dust obscuration. In this work, we apply the full set of magnitude and colour criteria used up until SDSS-DR7 in order to quantify the full impact of dust biasing against dusty and metal-rich DLAs. We apply the quasar target selection algorithm on a modelled population of intrinsic colours, and by exploring the parameter space consisting of redshift, ($z_{\\rm{\\small QSO}}$and zabs), optical extinction, and H\u2009i column density, we demonstrate how the selection probability depends on these variables. We quantify the dust bias on the following properties derived for DLAs at z\u00a0\u2248\u00a03: the incidence rate, the mass density of neutral hydrogen and metals, and the average metallicity. We find that all quantities are significantly affected. When considering all uncertainties, the mass density of neutral hydrogen is underestimated by 10\u201350\u00a0per\u2009cent, and the mass density in metals is underestimated by 30\u2013200\u00a0per\u2009cent. Lastly, we find that the bias depends on redshift. At redshift z\u00a0=\u00a02.2, the mass density of neutral hydrogen and metals might be underestimated by up to a factor of 2 and 5, respectively. Characterizing such a bias is crucial in order to accurately interpret and model the properties and metallicity evolution of absorption-selected galaxies.</jats:p>\n<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>One of the most fundamental baryonic matter components of galaxies is the neutral atomic hydrogen (H <jats:sc>i</jats:sc>).

We further use these simulations to make predictions for the total baryonic matter content of galaxies at <jats:italic>z</jats:italic> \u2248 6, and specifically the H <jats:sc>i</jats:sc> gas mass fraction.

Recently, using observations and reanalysis products, the central Indian Ocean (CIO) mode was found to be a natural mode in the ocean\u2010atmosphere coupled system and also shown to have a close mechanistic connection with the monsoon intraseasonal oscillation (MISO). In this study, the simulation of the actual CIO mode in historical Community Earth System Model (CESM) outputs is assessed by comparing with observations and reanalysis products. The simulation of the Madden\u2010Julian Oscillation, a major component of tropical intraseasonal variabilities (ISVs), is satisfactory. However, the CIO mode is not well captured in any of the CESM simulations considered here. The force and response relationship between the atmosphere and the ocean associated with the CIO mode in CESM is opposite to that in nature. The simulated meridional gradient of large\u2010scale zonal winds is too weak, which precludes the necessary energy conversion from the mean state to the ISVs and cuts off the energy source to MISO in CESM. The inability of CESM to reproduce the CIO mode seen clearly in nature highlights the CIO mode as a new dynamical framework for diagnosing the deficiencies in Indian summer monsoon simulation in climate models. The CIO mode is a coupled metric for evaluating climate models and may be a better indicator of a model's skill to accurately capture the tropical multiscale interactions over subseasonal to interannual timescales.</jats:p>\n<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Tropical sea surface temperature (SST) biases can cause atmospheric biases on global scales, hence SST needs to be represented well in climate models. A major source of uncertainties is the representation of turbulent mixing in the oceanic boundary layer, or mixed layer (ML). In the present study we focus on near\u2010inertial wave (NIW) induced mixing. The performance of two mixing schemes, Turbulent Kinetic Energy and K\u2010profile parameterization (KPP), is assessed at two sites (11.5\u00b0N, 23\u00b0W and 15\u00b0N, 38\u00b0W) in the tropical Atlantic. At 11.5\u00b0N, turbulence observations (eddy diffusivities, shear and stratification) are available for comparison. We find that the schemes differ in their representation of NIWs, but both under\u2010represent the observed enhanced diffusivities below the observed ML. However, we find that the models do mix below the ML at 15\u00b0N when a storm passes nearby. The near\u2010inertial oscillations remain below the ML for the following 10\u00a0days. Near\u2010inertial kinetic energy (NIKE) biases in the models are not directly correlated with the wind speed, the MLD biases, or the stratification at the ML base. Instead, NIKE biases are sensitive to the vertical mixing scheme parameterization. NIKE biases are lowest when the KPP scheme is used.</jats:p>\n<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Prediction and Research Moored Array in the Tropical Atlantic (PIRATA) is a multinational program initiated in 1997 in the tropical Atlantic to improve our understanding and ability to predict ocean\u2010atmosphere variability.

Conventional modeling of these noises assumes a linear response of the optical field to the fluctuations of cavity frequency. Fundamentally, however, this response is nonlinear. Here we show that nonlinearly transduced thermal fluctuations of cavity frequency can dominate the broadband noise in photodetection, even when the magnitude of fluctuations is much smaller than the cavity linewidth. We term this noise \u201cthermal intermodulation noise\u201d and show that for a resonant laser probe it manifests as intensity fluctuations. We report and characterize thermal intermodulation noise in an optomechanical cavity, where the frequency fluctuations are caused by mechanical Brownian motion, and find excellent agreement with our developed theoretical model. We demonstrate that the effect is particularly relevant to quantum optomechanics: using a phononic crystal <jats:inline-formula>\n\t    \n\t  </jats:inline-formula> membrane with a low-mass, soft-clamped mechanical mode, we are able to operate in the regime where measurement quantum backaction contributes as much force noise as the thermal environment does.

The radio detection method, utilizing Askaryan emission, can be used to detect these neutrinos in polar ice. The propagation of the radio pulses has to be modeled carefully to reconstruct the energy, direction, and flavor of the neutrino from the detected radio flashes. Here, we study the effect of birefringence in ice, which splits up the radio pulse into two orthogonal polarization components with slightly different propagation speeds. This provides useful signatures to determine the neutrino energy and is potentially important to determine the neutrino direction to degree precision. We calculated the effect of birefringence from first principles where the only free parameter is the dielectric tensor as a function of position. Our code, for the first time, can propagate full RF waveforms, taking interference due to changing polarization eigenvectors during propagation into account. The model is available open-source through the NuRadioMC framework. We compare our results to in-situ calibration data from the ARA and ARIANNA experiments and find good agreement for the available time delay measurements. This indicates a significant improvement of the prediction power of birefringence effects compared to previous models.

Magnetars are neutron stars with strong magnetic fields on the order of 10<jats:sup>15</jats:sup> G with a short decay lifetime of less than 10<jats:sup>4</jats:sup> yr. Due to their extremely short lifetimes, magnetars should follow the demographics of galaxies according to their current star formation rate (SFR). Moreover, we hypothesize that magnetars should follow the SFR profile within galaxies, which we assume to follow an exponential profile. We construct a simple model for the host galaxies of magnetars assuming these events track SFR in all galaxies and compare it to observed properties from a sample of 10 secure FRB hosts. We find the distribution of observed SFRs is inconsistent with the model at &gt;95% c.l. The offset distribution is consistent with this scenario; however, this could be due to the limited sample size and the seeing-limited estimates for the effective radii of the FRB host galaxies. Despite the recent association of an FRB with a magnetar in the Milky Way, magnetars may not be the only source of FRBs in the universe, yet any other successful model must account for the demographics of the FRB host in SFR and their observed galactocentric offsets.</jats:p>\n<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>The H <jats:sc>i</jats:sc> gas content is a key ingredient in galaxy evolution, the study of which has been limited to moderate cosmological distances for individual galaxies due to the weakness of the hyperfine H <jats:sc>i</jats:sc> 21 cm transition.

This bias arises as an effect of the magnitude and colour criteria utilized in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasar target selection up until data release 7 (DR7). The bias has previously been quantified assuming only a contribution from the dust obscuration. In this work, we apply the full set of magnitude and colour criteria used up until SDSS-DR7 in order to quantify the full impact of dust biasing against dusty and metal-rich DLAs. We apply the quasar target selection algorithm on a modelled population of intrinsic colours, and by exploring the parameter space consisting of redshift, ($z_{\\rm{\\small QSO}}$and zabs), optical extinction, and H\u2009i column density, we demonstrate how the selection probability depends on these variables. We quantify the dust bias on the following properties derived for DLAs at z\u00a0\u2248\u00a03: the incidence rate, the mass density of neutral hydrogen and metals, and the average metallicity. We find that all quantities are significantly affected. When considering all uncertainties, the mass density of neutral hydrogen is underestimated by 10\u201350\u00a0per\u2009cent, and the mass density in metals is underestimated by 30\u2013200\u00a0per\u2009cent. Lastly, we find that the bias depends on redshift. At redshift z\u00a0=\u00a02.2, the mass density of neutral hydrogen and metals might be underestimated by up to a factor of 2 and 5, respectively. Characterizing such a bias is crucial in order to accurately interpret and model the properties and metallicity evolution of absorption-selected galaxies.</jats:p>\n<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>One of the most fundamental baryonic matter components of galaxies is the neutral atomic hydrogen (H <jats:sc>i</jats:sc>).

We find a strong connection between C <jats:sc>ii</jats:sc> and H <jats:sc>i</jats:sc>, with the relation between this C <jats:sc>ii</jats:sc>-to-H <jats:sc>i</jats:sc> relation (<jats:italic>\u03b2</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:sub>[C <jats:sc>II</jats:sc>]</jats:sub>) being anticorrelated with the gas-phase metallicity of the simulated galaxies. We further use these simulations to make predictions for the total baryonic matter content of galaxies at <jats:italic>z</jats:italic> \u2248 6, and specifically the H <jats:sc>i</jats:sc> gas mass fraction.

Recently, using observations and reanalysis products, the central Indian Ocean (CIO) mode was found to be a natural mode in the ocean\u2010atmosphere coupled system and also shown to have a close mechanistic connection with the monsoon intraseasonal oscillation (MISO). In this study, the simulation of the actual CIO mode in historical Community Earth System Model (CESM) outputs is assessed by comparing with observations and reanalysis products. The simulation of the Madden\u2010Julian Oscillation, a major component of tropical intraseasonal variabilities (ISVs), is satisfactory. However, the CIO mode is not well captured in any of the CESM simulations considered here. The force and response relationship between the atmosphere and the ocean associated with the CIO mode in CESM is opposite to that in nature. The simulated meridional gradient of large\u2010scale zonal winds is too weak, which precludes the necessary energy conversion from the mean state to the ISVs and cuts off the energy source to MISO in CESM. The inability of CESM to reproduce the CIO mode seen clearly in nature highlights the CIO mode as a new dynamical framework for diagnosing the deficiencies in Indian summer monsoon simulation in climate models. The CIO mode is a coupled metric for evaluating climate models and may be a better indicator of a model's skill to accurately capture the tropical multiscale interactions over subseasonal to interannual timescales.</jats:p>\n<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Tropical sea surface temperature (SST) biases can cause atmospheric biases on global scales, hence SST needs to be represented well in climate models. A major source of uncertainties is the representation of turbulent mixing in the oceanic boundary layer, or mixed layer (ML).

The performance of two mixing schemes, Turbulent Kinetic Energy and K\u2010profile parameterization (KPP), is assessed at two sites (11.5\u00b0N, 23\u00b0W and 15\u00b0N, 38\u00b0W) in the tropical Atlantic. At 11.5\u00b0N, turbulence observations (eddy diffusivities, shear and stratification) are available for comparison. We find that the schemes differ in their representation of NIWs, but both under\u2010represent the observed enhanced diffusivities below the observed ML. However, we find that the models do mix below the ML at 15\u00b0N when a storm passes nearby. The near\u2010inertial oscillations remain below the ML for the following 10\u00a0days. Near\u2010inertial kinetic energy (NIKE) biases in the models are not directly correlated with the wind speed, the MLD biases, or the stratification at the ML base. Instead, NIKE biases are sensitive to the vertical mixing scheme parameterization. NIKE biases are lowest when the KPP scheme is used.</jats:p>\n<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Prediction and Research Moored Array in the Tropical Atlantic (PIRATA) is a multinational program initiated in 1997 in the tropical Atlantic to improve our understanding and ability to predict ocean\u2010atmosphere variability.

We term this noise \u201cthermal intermodulation noise\u201d and show that for a resonant laser probe it manifests as intensity fluctuations. We report and characterize thermal intermodulation noise in an optomechanical cavity, where the frequency fluctuations are caused by mechanical Brownian motion, and find excellent agreement with our developed theoretical model.

The radio detection method, utilizing Askaryan emission, can be used to detect these neutrinos in polar ice. The propagation of the radio pulses has to be modeled carefully to reconstruct the energy, direction, and flavor of the neutrino from the detected radio flashes. Here, we study the effect of birefringence in ice, which splits up the radio pulse into two orthogonal polarization components with slightly different propagation speeds. This provides useful signatures to determine the neutrino energy and is potentially important to determine the neutrino direction to degree precision. We calculated the effect of birefringence from first principles where the only free parameter is the dielectric tensor as a function of position. Our code, for the first time, can propagate full RF waveforms, taking interference due to changing polarization eigenvectors during propagation into account. The model is available open-source through the NuRadioMC framework. We compare our results to in-situ calibration data from the ARA and ARIANNA experiments and find good agreement for the available time delay measurements.

We use state-of-the-art ingredients in every stage of our forecasts: in the UHE neutrino flux predictions, the neutrino propagation inside Earth, the emission of neutrino-induced radio signals in the detector, their propagation and detection, and the treatment of backgrounds. After 10 years, if at least a few tens of UHE neutrino-induced events are detected, IceCube-Gen2 could measure the<jats:italic>\u03bdN</jats:italic>cross section at center-of-mass energies of<jats:inline-formula><jats:alternatives><jats:tex-math>$$ \\sqrt{s} $$</jats:tex-math><mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mml:msqrt><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:msqrt></mml:math></jats:alternatives></jats:inline-formula><jats:italic>\u2248</jats:italic>10\u2013100 TeV for the first time, with a precision comparable to that of its theory prediction.</jats:p>\n<jats:p>In-ice radio detection is a promising technique to discover and characterize ultrahigh-energy (UHE) neutrinos, with energies above <a:math xmlns:a=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\"><a:mrow><a:msup><a:mrow><a:mn>10</a:mn></a:mrow><a:mrow><a:mn>17</a:mn></a:mrow></a:msup><a:mtext>\u2009</a:mtext><a:mtext>\u2009</a:mtext><a:mi>eV</a:mi></a:mrow></a:math>, adopted by present\u2014ARA, ARIANNA, and RNO-G\u2014and planned\u2014IceCube-Gen2\u2014experiments. So far, their ability to measure neutrino flavor had remained unexplored. We show and quantify how the neutrino flavor can be measured with in-ice radio detectors using two complementary detection channels.

This newfound sensitivity could allow us to infer the UHE neutrino flavor composition at their sources\u2014and thus the neutrino production mechanism\u2014and to probe UHE neutrino physics.</jats:p>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title/>\n            <jats:supplementary-material>\n              <jats:permissions>\n                <jats:copyright-statement>Published by the American Physical Society</jats:copyright-statement>\n                <jats:copyright-year>2024</jats:copyright-year>\n              </jats:permissions>\n            </jats:supplementary-material>\n          </jats:sec>",

Magnetars are neutron stars with strong magnetic fields on the order of 10<jats:sup>15</jats:sup> G with a short decay lifetime of less than 10<jats:sup>4</jats:sup> yr. Due to their extremely short lifetimes, magnetars should follow the demographics of galaxies according to their current star formation rate (SFR). Moreover, we hypothesize that magnetars should follow the SFR profile within galaxies, which we assume to follow an exponential profile. We construct a simple model for the host galaxies of magnetars assuming these events track SFR in all galaxies and compare it to observed properties from a sample of 10 secure FRB hosts. We find the distribution of observed SFRs is inconsistent with the model at &gt;95% c.l. The offset distribution is consistent with this scenario; however, this could be due to the limited sample size and the seeing-limited estimates for the effective radii of the FRB host galaxies. Despite the recent association of an FRB with a magnetar in the Milky Way, magnetars may not be the only source of FRBs in the universe, yet any other successful model must account for the demographics of the FRB host in SFR and their observed galactocentric offsets.</jats:p>\n<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>The H <jats:sc>i</jats:sc> gas content is a key ingredient in galaxy evolution, the study of which has been limited to moderate cosmological distances for individual galaxies due to the weakness of the hyperfine H <jats:sc>i</jats:sc> 21 cm transition.

This bias arises as an effect of the magnitude and colour criteria utilized in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasar target selection up until data release 7 (DR7). The bias has previously been quantified assuming only a contribution from the dust obscuration. In this work, we apply the full set of magnitude and colour criteria used up until SDSS-DR7 in order to quantify the full impact of dust biasing against dusty and metal-rich DLAs. We apply the quasar target selection algorithm on a modelled population of intrinsic colours, and by exploring the parameter space consisting of redshift, ($z_{\\rm{\\small QSO}}$and zabs), optical extinction, and H\u2009i column density, we demonstrate how the selection probability depends on these variables. We quantify the dust bias on the following properties derived for DLAs at z\u00a0\u2248\u00a03: the incidence rate, the mass density of neutral hydrogen and metals, and the average metallicity. We find that all quantities are significantly affected. When considering all uncertainties, the mass density of neutral hydrogen is underestimated by 10\u201350\u00a0per\u2009cent, and the mass density in metals is underestimated by 30\u2013200\u00a0per\u2009cent. Lastly, we find that the bias depends on redshift. At redshift z\u00a0=\u00a02.2, the mass density of neutral hydrogen and metals might be underestimated by up to a factor of 2 and 5, respectively. Characterizing such a bias is crucial in order to accurately interpret and model the properties and metallicity evolution of absorption-selected galaxies.</jats:p>\n<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>One of the most fundamental baryonic matter components of galaxies is the neutral atomic hydrogen (H <jats:sc>i</jats:sc>).

Recently, using observations and reanalysis products, the central Indian Ocean (CIO) mode was found to be a natural mode in the ocean\u2010atmosphere coupled system and also shown to have a close mechanistic connection with the monsoon intraseasonal oscillation (MISO). In this study, the simulation of the actual CIO mode in historical Community Earth System Model (CESM) outputs is assessed by comparing with observations and reanalysis products. The simulation of the Madden\u2010Julian Oscillation, a major component of tropical intraseasonal variabilities (ISVs), is satisfactory. However, the CIO mode is not well captured in any of the CESM simulations considered here. The force and response relationship between the atmosphere and the ocean associated with the CIO mode in CESM is opposite to that in nature. The simulated meridional gradient of large\u2010scale zonal winds is too weak, which precludes the necessary energy conversion from the mean state to the ISVs and cuts off the energy source to MISO in CESM. The inability of CESM to reproduce the CIO mode seen clearly in nature highlights the CIO mode as a new dynamical framework for diagnosing the deficiencies in Indian summer monsoon simulation in climate models. The CIO mode is a coupled metric for evaluating climate models and may be a better indicator of a model's skill to accurately capture the tropical multiscale interactions over subseasonal to interannual timescales.</jats:p>\n<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Tropical sea surface temperature (SST) biases can cause atmospheric biases on global scales, hence SST needs to be represented well in climate models. A major source of uncertainties is the representation of turbulent mixing in the oceanic boundary layer, or mixed layer (ML). In the present study we focus on near\u2010inertial wave (NIW) induced mixing. The performance of two mixing schemes, Turbulent Kinetic Energy and K\u2010profile parameterization (KPP), is assessed at two sites (11.5\u00b0N, 23\u00b0W and 15\u00b0N, 38\u00b0W) in the tropical Atlantic. At 11.5\u00b0N, turbulence observations (eddy diffusivities, shear and stratification) are available for comparison. We find that the schemes differ in their representation of NIWs, but both under\u2010represent the observed enhanced diffusivities below the observed ML. However, we find that the models do mix below the ML at 15\u00b0N when a storm passes nearby. The near\u2010inertial oscillations remain below the ML for the following 10\u00a0days. Near\u2010inertial kinetic energy (NIKE) biases in the models are not directly correlated with the wind speed, the MLD biases, or the stratification at the ML base. Instead, NIKE biases are sensitive to the vertical mixing scheme parameterization. NIKE biases are lowest when the KPP scheme is used.</jats:p>\n<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Prediction and Research Moored Array in the Tropical Atlantic (PIRATA) is a multinational program initiated in 1997 in the tropical Atlantic to improve our understanding and ability to predict ocean\u2010atmosphere variability.

Conventional modeling of these noises assumes a linear response of the optical field to the fluctuations of cavity frequency. Fundamentally, however, this response is nonlinear. Here we show that nonlinearly transduced thermal fluctuations of cavity frequency can dominate the broadband noise in photodetection, even when the magnitude of fluctuations is much smaller than the cavity linewidth. We term this noise \u201cthermal intermodulation noise\u201d and show that for a resonant laser probe it manifests as intensity fluctuations. We report and characterize thermal intermodulation noise in an optomechanical cavity, where the frequency fluctuations are caused by mechanical Brownian motion, and find excellent agreement with our developed theoretical model. We demonstrate that the effect is particularly relevant to quantum optomechanics: using a phononic crystal <jats:inline-formula>\n\t    \n\t  </jats:inline-formula> membrane with a low-mass, soft-clamped mechanical mode, we are able to operate in the regime where measurement quantum backaction contributes as much force noise as the thermal environment does.

The radio detection method, utilizing Askaryan emission, can be used to detect these neutrinos in polar ice. The propagation of the radio pulses has to be modeled carefully to reconstruct the energy, direction, and flavor of the neutrino from the detected radio flashes. Here, we study the effect of birefringence in ice, which splits up the radio pulse into two orthogonal polarization components with slightly different propagation speeds. This provides useful signatures to determine the neutrino energy and is potentially important to determine the neutrino direction to degree precision. We calculated the effect of birefringence from first principles where the only free parameter is the dielectric tensor as a function of position. Our code, for the first time, can propagate full RF waveforms, taking interference due to changing polarization eigenvectors during propagation into account. The model is available open-source through the NuRadioMC framework. We compare our results to in-situ calibration data from the ARA and ARIANNA experiments and find good agreement for the available time delay measurements. This indicates a significant improvement of the prediction power of birefringence effects compared to previous models.

Magnetars are neutron stars with strong magnetic fields on the order of 10<jats:sup>15</jats:sup> G with a short decay lifetime of less than 10<jats:sup>4</jats:sup> yr. Due to their extremely short lifetimes, magnetars should follow the demographics of galaxies according to their current star formation rate (SFR). Moreover, we hypothesize that magnetars should follow the SFR profile within galaxies, which we assume to follow an exponential profile. We construct a simple model for the host galaxies of magnetars assuming these events track SFR in all galaxies and compare it to observed properties from a sample of 10 secure FRB hosts. We find the distribution of observed SFRs is inconsistent with the model at &gt;95% c.l. The offset distribution is consistent with this scenario; however, this could be due to the limited sample size and the seeing-limited estimates for the effective radii of the FRB host galaxies. Despite the recent association of an FRB with a magnetar in the Milky Way, magnetars may not be the only source of FRBs in the universe, yet any other successful model must account for the demographics of the FRB host in SFR and their observed galactocentric offsets.</jats:p>\n<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>The H <jats:sc>i</jats:sc> gas content is a key ingredient in galaxy evolution, the study of which has been limited to moderate cosmological distances for individual galaxies due to the weakness of the hyperfine H <jats:sc>i</jats:sc> 21 cm transition.

This bias arises as an effect of the magnitude and colour criteria utilized in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasar target selection up until data release 7 (DR7). The bias has previously been quantified assuming only a contribution from the dust obscuration. In this work, we apply the full set of magnitude and colour criteria used up until SDSS-DR7 in order to quantify the full impact of dust biasing against dusty and metal-rich DLAs. We apply the quasar target selection algorithm on a modelled population of intrinsic colours, and by exploring the parameter space consisting of redshift, ($z_{\\rm{\\small QSO}}$and zabs), optical extinction, and H\u2009i column density, we demonstrate how the selection probability depends on these variables. We quantify the dust bias on the following properties derived for DLAs at z\u00a0\u2248\u00a03: the incidence rate, the mass density of neutral hydrogen and metals, and the average metallicity. We find that all quantities are significantly affected. When considering all uncertainties, the mass density of neutral hydrogen is underestimated by 10\u201350\u00a0per\u2009cent, and the mass density in metals is underestimated by 30\u2013200\u00a0per\u2009cent. Lastly, we find that the bias depends on redshift. At redshift z\u00a0=\u00a02.2, the mass density of neutral hydrogen and metals might be underestimated by up to a factor of 2 and 5, respectively. Characterizing such a bias is crucial in order to accurately interpret and model the properties and metallicity evolution of absorption-selected galaxies.</jats:p>\n<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>One of the most fundamental baryonic matter components of galaxies is the neutral atomic hydrogen (H <jats:sc>i</jats:sc>).

We select 11,125 star-forming galaxies from the <jats:sc>simba</jats:sc> simulations, with far-infrared line emissions postprocessed and modeled within the S<jats:sc>igame</jats:sc> framework. We find a strong connection between C <jats:sc>ii</jats:sc> and H <jats:sc>i</jats:sc>, with the relation between this C <jats:sc>ii</jats:sc>-to-H <jats:sc>i</jats:sc> relation (<jats:italic>\u03b2</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:sub>[C <jats:sc>II</jats:sc>]</jats:sub>) being anticorrelated with the gas-phase metallicity of the simulated galaxies. We further use these simulations to make predictions for the total baryonic matter content of galaxies at <jats:italic>z</jats:italic> \u2248 6, and specifically the H <jats:sc>i</jats:sc> gas mass fraction.

Recently, using observations and reanalysis products, the central Indian Ocean (CIO) mode was found to be a natural mode in the ocean\u2010atmosphere coupled system and also shown to have a close mechanistic connection with the monsoon intraseasonal oscillation (MISO). In this study, the simulation of the actual CIO mode in historical Community Earth System Model (CESM) outputs is assessed by comparing with observations and reanalysis products. The simulation of the Madden\u2010Julian Oscillation, a major component of tropical intraseasonal variabilities (ISVs), is satisfactory. However, the CIO mode is not well captured in any of the CESM simulations considered here. The force and response relationship between the atmosphere and the ocean associated with the CIO mode in CESM is opposite to that in nature. The simulated meridional gradient of large\u2010scale zonal winds is too weak, which precludes the necessary energy conversion from the mean state to the ISVs and cuts off the energy source to MISO in CESM. The inability of CESM to reproduce the CIO mode seen clearly in nature highlights the CIO mode as a new dynamical framework for diagnosing the deficiencies in Indian summer monsoon simulation in climate models. The CIO mode is a coupled metric for evaluating climate models and may be a better indicator of a model's skill to accurately capture the tropical multiscale interactions over subseasonal to interannual timescales.</jats:p>\n<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Tropical sea surface temperature (SST) biases can cause atmospheric biases on global scales, hence SST needs to be represented well in climate models. A major source of uncertainties is the representation of turbulent mixing in the oceanic boundary layer, or mixed layer (ML). In the present study we focus on near\u2010inertial wave (NIW) induced mixing. The performance of two mixing schemes, Turbulent Kinetic Energy and K\u2010profile parameterization (KPP), is assessed at two sites (11.5\u00b0N, 23\u00b0W and 15\u00b0N, 38\u00b0W) in the tropical Atlantic. At 11.5\u00b0N, turbulence observations (eddy diffusivities, shear and stratification) are available for comparison. We find that the schemes differ in their representation of NIWs, but both under\u2010represent the observed enhanced diffusivities below the observed ML. However, we find that the models do mix below the ML at 15\u00b0N when a storm passes nearby. The near\u2010inertial oscillations remain below the ML for the following 10\u00a0days. Near\u2010inertial kinetic energy (NIKE) biases in the models are not directly correlated with the wind speed, the MLD biases, or the stratification at the ML base. Instead, NIKE biases are sensitive to the vertical mixing scheme parameterization. NIKE biases are lowest when the KPP scheme is used.</jats:p>\n<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Prediction and Research Moored Array in the Tropical Atlantic (PIRATA) is a multinational program initiated in 1997 in the tropical Atlantic to improve our understanding and ability to predict ocean\u2010atmosphere variability.

We term this noise \u201cthermal intermodulation noise\u201d and show that for a resonant laser probe it manifests as intensity fluctuations. We report and characterize thermal intermodulation noise in an optomechanical cavity, where the frequency fluctuations are caused by mechanical Brownian motion, and find excellent agreement with our developed theoretical model. We demonstrate that the effect is particularly relevant to quantum optomechanics: using a phononic crystal <jats:inline-formula>\n\t    \n\t  </jats:inline-formula> membrane with a low-mass, soft-clamped mechanical mode, we are able to operate in the regime where measurement quantum backaction contributes as much force noise as the thermal environment does.

The radio detection method, utilizing Askaryan emission, can be used to detect these neutrinos in polar ice. The propagation of the radio pulses has to be modeled carefully to reconstruct the energy, direction, and flavor of the neutrino from the detected radio flashes. Here, we study the effect of birefringence in ice, which splits up the radio pulse into two orthogonal polarization components with slightly different propagation speeds. This provides useful signatures to determine the neutrino energy and is potentially important to determine the neutrino direction to degree precision. We calculated the effect of birefringence from first principles where the only free parameter is the dielectric tensor as a function of position. Our code, for the first time, can propagate full RF waveforms, taking interference due to changing polarization eigenvectors during propagation into account. The model is available open-source through the NuRadioMC framework. We compare our results to in-situ calibration data from the ARA and ARIANNA experiments and find good agreement for the available time delay measurements. This indicates a significant improvement of the prediction power of birefringence effects compared to previous models.

Magnetars are neutron stars with strong magnetic fields on the order of 10<jats:sup>15</jats:sup> G with a short decay lifetime of less than 10<jats:sup>4</jats:sup> yr. Due to their extremely short lifetimes, magnetars should follow the demographics of galaxies according to their current star formation rate (SFR). Moreover, we hypothesize that magnetars should follow the SFR profile within galaxies, which we assume to follow an exponential profile. We construct a simple model for the host galaxies of magnetars assuming these events track SFR in all galaxies and compare it to observed properties from a sample of 10 secure FRB hosts. We find the distribution of observed SFRs is inconsistent with the model at &gt;95% c.l. The offset distribution is consistent with this scenario; however, this could be due to the limited sample size and the seeing-limited estimates for the effective radii of the FRB host galaxies. Despite the recent association of an FRB with a magnetar in the Milky Way, magnetars may not be the only source of FRBs in the universe, yet any other successful model must account for the demographics of the FRB host in SFR and their observed galactocentric offsets.</jats:p>\n<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>The H <jats:sc>i</jats:sc> gas content is a key ingredient in galaxy evolution, the study of which has been limited to moderate cosmological distances for individual galaxies due to the weakness of the hyperfine H <jats:sc>i</jats:sc> 21 cm transition.

By compiling recent [C <jats:sc>ii</jats:sc>]-158 <jats:italic>\u03bc</jats:italic>m emission line measurements we quantify the evolution of the H <jats:sc>i</jats:sc> content in galaxies through cosmic time.

The H <jats:sc>i</jats:sc> fraction of the total baryonic mass increases from around 20% at <jats:italic>z</jats:italic> = 0 to about 60% at <jats:italic>z</jats:italic> \u223c 6.

This bias arises as an effect of the magnitude and colour criteria utilized in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasar target selection up until data release 7 (DR7). The bias has previously been quantified assuming only a contribution from the dust obscuration. In this work, we apply the full set of magnitude and colour criteria used up until SDSS-DR7 in order to quantify the full impact of dust biasing against dusty and metal-rich DLAs. We apply the quasar target selection algorithm on a modelled population of intrinsic colours, and by exploring the parameter space consisting of redshift, ($z_{\\rm{\\small QSO}}$and zabs), optical extinction, and H\u2009i column density, we demonstrate how the selection probability depends on these variables. We quantify the dust bias on the following properties derived for DLAs at z\u00a0\u2248\u00a03: the incidence rate, the mass density of neutral hydrogen and metals, and the average metallicity. We find that all quantities are significantly affected. When considering all uncertainties, the mass density of neutral hydrogen is underestimated by 10\u201350\u00a0per\u2009cent, and the mass density in metals is underestimated by 30\u2013200\u00a0per\u2009cent. Lastly, we find that the bias depends on redshift. At redshift z\u00a0=\u00a02.2, the mass density of neutral hydrogen and metals might be underestimated by up to a factor of 2 and 5, respectively. Characterizing such a bias is crucial in order to accurately interpret and model the properties and metallicity evolution of absorption-selected galaxies.</jats:p>\n<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>One of the most fundamental baryonic matter components of galaxies is the neutral atomic hydrogen (H <jats:sc>i</jats:sc>).

We select 11,125 star-forming galaxies from the <jats:sc>simba</jats:sc> simulations, with far-infrared line emissions postprocessed and modeled within the S<jats:sc>igame</jats:sc> framework. We find a strong connection between C <jats:sc>ii</jats:sc> and H <jats:sc>i</jats:sc>, with the relation between this C <jats:sc>ii</jats:sc>-to-H <jats:sc>i</jats:sc> relation (<jats:italic>\u03b2</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:sub>[C <jats:sc>II</jats:sc>]</jats:sub>) being anticorrelated with the gas-phase metallicity of the simulated galaxies. We further use these simulations to make predictions for the total baryonic matter content of galaxies at <jats:italic>z</jats:italic> \u2248 6, and specifically the H <jats:sc>i</jats:sc> gas mass fraction.

Recently, using observations and reanalysis products, the central Indian Ocean (CIO) mode was found to be a natural mode in the ocean\u2010atmosphere coupled system and also shown to have a close mechanistic connection with the monsoon intraseasonal oscillation (MISO). In this study, the simulation of the actual CIO mode in historical Community Earth System Model (CESM) outputs is assessed by comparing with observations and reanalysis products. The simulation of the Madden\u2010Julian Oscillation, a major component of tropical intraseasonal variabilities (ISVs), is satisfactory. However, the CIO mode is not well captured in any of the CESM simulations considered here. The force and response relationship between the atmosphere and the ocean associated with the CIO mode in CESM is opposite to that in nature. The simulated meridional gradient of large\u2010scale zonal winds is too weak, which precludes the necessary energy conversion from the mean state to the ISVs and cuts off the energy source to MISO in CESM. The inability of CESM to reproduce the CIO mode seen clearly in nature highlights the CIO mode as a new dynamical framework for diagnosing the deficiencies in Indian summer monsoon simulation in climate models. The CIO mode is a coupled metric for evaluating climate models and may be a better indicator of a model's skill to accurately capture the tropical multiscale interactions over subseasonal to interannual timescales.</jats:p>\n<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Tropical sea surface temperature (SST) biases can cause atmospheric biases on global scales, hence SST needs to be represented well in climate models. A major source of uncertainties is the representation of turbulent mixing in the oceanic boundary layer, or mixed layer (ML). In the present study we focus on near\u2010inertial wave (NIW) induced mixing. The performance of two mixing schemes, Turbulent Kinetic Energy and K\u2010profile parameterization (KPP), is assessed at two sites (11.5\u00b0N, 23\u00b0W and 15\u00b0N, 38\u00b0W) in the tropical Atlantic. At 11.5\u00b0N, turbulence observations (eddy diffusivities, shear and stratification) are available for comparison. We find that the schemes differ in their representation of NIWs, but both under\u2010represent the observed enhanced diffusivities below the observed ML. However, we find that the models do mix below the ML at 15\u00b0N when a storm passes nearby. The near\u2010inertial oscillations remain below the ML for the following 10\u00a0days. Near\u2010inertial kinetic energy (NIKE) biases in the models are not directly correlated with the wind speed, the MLD biases, or the stratification at the ML base. Instead, NIKE biases are sensitive to the vertical mixing scheme parameterization. NIKE biases are lowest when the KPP scheme is used.</jats:p>\n<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Prediction and Research Moored Array in the Tropical Atlantic (PIRATA) is a multinational program initiated in 1997 in the tropical Atlantic to improve our understanding and ability to predict ocean\u2010atmosphere variability.

The propagation of the radio pulses has to be modeled carefully to reconstruct the energy, direction, and flavor of the neutrino from the detected radio flashes. Here, we study the effect of birefringence in ice, which splits up the radio pulse into two orthogonal polarization components with slightly different propagation speeds. This provides useful signatures to determine the neutrino energy and is potentially important to determine the neutrino direction to degree precision. We calculated the effect of birefringence from first principles where the only free parameter is the dielectric tensor as a function of position. Our code, for the first time, can propagate full RF waveforms, taking interference due to changing polarization eigenvectors during propagation into account. The model is available open-source through the NuRadioMC framework. We compare our results to in-situ calibration data from the ARA and ARIANNA experiments and find good agreement for the available time delay measurements.

Soon, ultra-high-energy (UHE) cosmic neutrinos, with energies above 100 PeV, could take us farther. So far, they have evaded discovery, but upcoming UHE neutrino telescopes endeavor to find them. We present the first detailed measurement forecasts of the UHE<jats:italic>\u03bdN</jats:italic>cross section, geared to IceCube-Gen2, one of the leading detectors under planning. We use state-of-the-art ingredients in every stage of our forecasts: in the UHE neutrino flux predictions, the neutrino propagation inside Earth, the emission of neutrino-induced radio signals in the detector, their propagation and detection, and the treatment of backgrounds. After 10 years, if at least a few tens of UHE neutrino-induced events are detected, IceCube-Gen2 could measure the<jats:italic>\u03bdN</jats:italic>cross section at center-of-mass energies of<jats:inline-formula><jats:alternatives><jats:tex-math>$$ \\sqrt{s} $$</jats:tex-math><mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mml:msqrt><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:msqrt></mml:math></jats:alternatives></jats:inline-formula><jats:italic>\u2248</jats:italic>10\u2013100 TeV for the first time, with a precision comparable to that of its theory prediction.</jats:p>\n<jats:p>In-ice radio detection is a promising technique to discover and characterize ultrahigh-energy (UHE) neutrinos, with energies above <a:math xmlns:a=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\"><a:mrow><a:msup><a:mrow><a:mn>10</a:mn></a:mrow><a:mrow><a:mn>17</a:mn></a:mrow></a:msup><a:mtext>\u2009</a:mtext><a:mtext>\u2009</a:mtext><a:mi>eV</a:mi></a:mrow></a:math>, adopted by present\u2014ARA, ARIANNA, and RNO-G\u2014and planned\u2014IceCube-Gen2\u2014experiments.

Magnetars are neutron stars with strong magnetic fields on the order of 10<jats:sup>15</jats:sup> G with a short decay lifetime of less than 10<jats:sup>4</jats:sup> yr. Due to their extremely short lifetimes, magnetars should follow the demographics of galaxies according to their current star formation rate (SFR). Moreover, we hypothesize that magnetars should follow the SFR profile within galaxies, which we assume to follow an exponential profile. We construct a simple model for the host galaxies of magnetars assuming these events track SFR in all galaxies and compare it to observed properties from a sample of 10 secure FRB hosts. We find the distribution of observed SFRs is inconsistent with the model at &gt;95% c.l. The offset distribution is consistent with this scenario; however, this could be due to the limited sample size and the seeing-limited estimates for the effective radii of the FRB host galaxies. Despite the recent association of an FRB with a magnetar in the Milky Way, magnetars may not be the only source of FRBs in the universe, yet any other successful model must account for the demographics of the FRB host in SFR and their observed galactocentric offsets.</jats:p>\n<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>The H <jats:sc>i</jats:sc> gas content is a key ingredient in galaxy evolution, the study of which has been limited to moderate cosmological distances for individual galaxies due to the weakness of the hyperfine H <jats:sc>i</jats:sc> 21 cm transition.

This bias arises as an effect of the magnitude and colour criteria utilized in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasar target selection up until data release 7 (DR7). The bias has previously been quantified assuming only a contribution from the dust obscuration. In this work, we apply the full set of magnitude and colour criteria used up until SDSS-DR7 in order to quantify the full impact of dust biasing against dusty and metal-rich DLAs. We apply the quasar target selection algorithm on a modelled population of intrinsic colours, and by exploring the parameter space consisting of redshift, ($z_{\\rm{\\small QSO}}$and zabs), optical extinction, and H\u2009i column density, we demonstrate how the selection probability depends on these variables. We quantify the dust bias on the following properties derived for DLAs at z\u00a0\u2248\u00a03: the incidence rate, the mass density of neutral hydrogen and metals, and the average metallicity. We find that all quantities are significantly affected. When considering all uncertainties, the mass density of neutral hydrogen is underestimated by 10\u201350\u00a0per\u2009cent, and the mass density in metals is underestimated by 30\u2013200\u00a0per\u2009cent. Lastly, we find that the bias depends on redshift. At redshift z\u00a0=\u00a02.2, the mass density of neutral hydrogen and metals might be underestimated by up to a factor of 2 and 5, respectively. Characterizing such a bias is crucial in order to accurately interpret and model the properties and metallicity evolution of absorption-selected galaxies.</jats:p>\n<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>One of the most fundamental baryonic matter components of galaxies is the neutral atomic hydrogen (H <jats:sc>i</jats:sc>).

Recently, using observations and reanalysis products, the central Indian Ocean (CIO) mode was found to be a natural mode in the ocean\u2010atmosphere coupled system and also shown to have a close mechanistic connection with the monsoon intraseasonal oscillation (MISO). In this study, the simulation of the actual CIO mode in historical Community Earth System Model (CESM) outputs is assessed by comparing with observations and reanalysis products. The simulation of the Madden\u2010Julian Oscillation, a major component of tropical intraseasonal variabilities (ISVs), is satisfactory. However, the CIO mode is not well captured in any of the CESM simulations considered here. The force and response relationship between the atmosphere and the ocean associated with the CIO mode in CESM is opposite to that in nature. The simulated meridional gradient of large\u2010scale zonal winds is too weak, which precludes the necessary energy conversion from the mean state to the ISVs and cuts off the energy source to MISO in CESM. The inability of CESM to reproduce the CIO mode seen clearly in nature highlights the CIO mode as a new dynamical framework for diagnosing the deficiencies in Indian summer monsoon simulation in climate models. The CIO mode is a coupled metric for evaluating climate models and may be a better indicator of a model's skill to accurately capture the tropical multiscale interactions over subseasonal to interannual timescales.</jats:p>\n<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Tropical sea surface temperature (SST) biases can cause atmospheric biases on global scales, hence SST needs to be represented well in climate models. A major source of uncertainties is the representation of turbulent mixing in the oceanic boundary layer, or mixed layer (ML). In the present study we focus on near\u2010inertial wave (NIW) induced mixing. The performance of two mixing schemes, Turbulent Kinetic Energy and K\u2010profile parameterization (KPP), is assessed at two sites (11.5\u00b0N, 23\u00b0W and 15\u00b0N, 38\u00b0W) in the tropical Atlantic. At 11.5\u00b0N, turbulence observations (eddy diffusivities, shear and stratification) are available for comparison. We find that the schemes differ in their representation of NIWs, but both under\u2010represent the observed enhanced diffusivities below the observed ML. However, we find that the models do mix below the ML at 15\u00b0N when a storm passes nearby. The near\u2010inertial oscillations remain below the ML for the following 10\u00a0days. Near\u2010inertial kinetic energy (NIKE) biases in the models are not directly correlated with the wind speed, the MLD biases, or the stratification at the ML base. Instead, NIKE biases are sensitive to the vertical mixing scheme parameterization. NIKE biases are lowest when the KPP scheme is used.</jats:p>\n<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Prediction and Research Moored Array in the Tropical Atlantic (PIRATA) is a multinational program initiated in 1997 in the tropical Atlantic to improve our understanding and ability to predict ocean\u2010atmosphere variability.

The radio detection method, utilizing Askaryan emission, can be used to detect these neutrinos in polar ice. The propagation of the radio pulses has to be modeled carefully to reconstruct the energy, direction, and flavor of the neutrino from the detected radio flashes. Here, we study the effect of birefringence in ice, which splits up the radio pulse into two orthogonal polarization components with slightly different propagation speeds. This provides useful signatures to determine the neutrino energy and is potentially important to determine the neutrino direction to degree precision. We calculated the effect of birefringence from first principles where the only free parameter is the dielectric tensor as a function of position. Our code, for the first time, can propagate full RF waveforms, taking interference due to changing polarization eigenvectors during propagation into account. The model is available open-source through the NuRadioMC framework. We compare our results to in-situ calibration data from the ARA and ARIANNA experiments and find good agreement for the available time delay measurements. This indicates a significant improvement of the prediction power of birefringence effects compared to previous models.

Magnetars are neutron stars with strong magnetic fields on the order of 10<jats:sup>15</jats:sup> G with a short decay lifetime of less than 10<jats:sup>4</jats:sup> yr. Due to their extremely short lifetimes, magnetars should follow the demographics of galaxies according to their current star formation rate (SFR). Moreover, we hypothesize that magnetars should follow the SFR profile within galaxies, which we assume to follow an exponential profile. We construct a simple model for the host galaxies of magnetars assuming these events track SFR in all galaxies and compare it to observed properties from a sample of 10 secure FRB hosts. We find the distribution of observed SFRs is inconsistent with the model at &gt;95% c.l. The offset distribution is consistent with this scenario; however, this could be due to the limited sample size and the seeing-limited estimates for the effective radii of the FRB host galaxies. Despite the recent association of an FRB with a magnetar in the Milky Way, magnetars may not be the only source of FRBs in the universe, yet any other successful model must account for the demographics of the FRB host in SFR and their observed galactocentric offsets.</jats:p>\n<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>The H <jats:sc>i</jats:sc> gas content is a key ingredient in galaxy evolution, the study of which has been limited to moderate cosmological distances for individual galaxies due to the weakness of the hyperfine H <jats:sc>i</jats:sc> 21 cm transition.

The H <jats:sc>i</jats:sc> fraction of the total baryonic mass increases from around 20% at <jats:italic>z</jats:italic> = 0 to about 60% at <jats:italic>z</jats:italic> \u223c 6.

This bias arises as an effect of the magnitude and colour criteria utilized in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasar target selection up until data release 7 (DR7). The bias has previously been quantified assuming only a contribution from the dust obscuration. In this work, we apply the full set of magnitude and colour criteria used up until SDSS-DR7 in order to quantify the full impact of dust biasing against dusty and metal-rich DLAs. We apply the quasar target selection algorithm on a modelled population of intrinsic colours, and by exploring the parameter space consisting of redshift, ($z_{\\rm{\\small QSO}}$and zabs), optical extinction, and H\u2009i column density, we demonstrate how the selection probability depends on these variables. We quantify the dust bias on the following properties derived for DLAs at z\u00a0\u2248\u00a03: the incidence rate, the mass density of neutral hydrogen and metals, and the average metallicity. We find that all quantities are significantly affected. When considering all uncertainties, the mass density of neutral hydrogen is underestimated by 10\u201350\u00a0per\u2009cent, and the mass density in metals is underestimated by 30\u2013200\u00a0per\u2009cent. Lastly, we find that the bias depends on redshift. At redshift z\u00a0=\u00a02.2, the mass density of neutral hydrogen and metals might be underestimated by up to a factor of 2 and 5, respectively. Characterizing such a bias is crucial in order to accurately interpret and model the properties and metallicity evolution of absorption-selected galaxies.</jats:p>\n<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>One of the most fundamental baryonic matter components of galaxies is the neutral atomic hydrogen (H <jats:sc>i</jats:sc>).

We select 11,125 star-forming galaxies from the <jats:sc>simba</jats:sc> simulations, with far-infrared line emissions postprocessed and modeled within the S<jats:sc>igame</jats:sc> framework. We find a strong connection between C <jats:sc>ii</jats:sc> and H <jats:sc>i</jats:sc>, with the relation between this C <jats:sc>ii</jats:sc>-to-H <jats:sc>i</jats:sc> relation (<jats:italic>\u03b2</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:sub>[C <jats:sc>II</jats:sc>]</jats:sub>) being anticorrelated with the gas-phase metallicity of the simulated galaxies. We further use these simulations to make predictions for the total baryonic matter content of galaxies at <jats:italic>z</jats:italic> \u2248 6, and specifically the H <jats:sc>i</jats:sc> gas mass fraction.

Recently, using observations and reanalysis products, the central Indian Ocean (CIO) mode was found to be a natural mode in the ocean\u2010atmosphere coupled system and also shown to have a close mechanistic connection with the monsoon intraseasonal oscillation (MISO). In this study, the simulation of the actual CIO mode in historical Community Earth System Model (CESM) outputs is assessed by comparing with observations and reanalysis products. The simulation of the Madden\u2010Julian Oscillation, a major component of tropical intraseasonal variabilities (ISVs), is satisfactory. However, the CIO mode is not well captured in any of the CESM simulations considered here. The force and response relationship between the atmosphere and the ocean associated with the CIO mode in CESM is opposite to that in nature. The simulated meridional gradient of large\u2010scale zonal winds is too weak, which precludes the necessary energy conversion from the mean state to the ISVs and cuts off the energy source to MISO in CESM. The inability of CESM to reproduce the CIO mode seen clearly in nature highlights the CIO mode as a new dynamical framework for diagnosing the deficiencies in Indian summer monsoon simulation in climate models. The CIO mode is a coupled metric for evaluating climate models and may be a better indicator of a model's skill to accurately capture the tropical multiscale interactions over subseasonal to interannual timescales.</jats:p>\n<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Tropical sea surface temperature (SST) biases can cause atmospheric biases on global scales, hence SST needs to be represented well in climate models. A major source of uncertainties is the representation of turbulent mixing in the oceanic boundary layer, or mixed layer (ML). In the present study we focus on near\u2010inertial wave (NIW) induced mixing. The performance of two mixing schemes, Turbulent Kinetic Energy and K\u2010profile parameterization (KPP), is assessed at two sites (11.5\u00b0N, 23\u00b0W and 15\u00b0N, 38\u00b0W) in the tropical Atlantic. At 11.5\u00b0N, turbulence observations (eddy diffusivities, shear and stratification) are available for comparison. We find that the schemes differ in their representation of NIWs, but both under\u2010represent the observed enhanced diffusivities below the observed ML. However, we find that the models do mix below the ML at 15\u00b0N when a storm passes nearby. The near\u2010inertial oscillations remain below the ML for the following 10\u00a0days. Near\u2010inertial kinetic energy (NIKE) biases in the models are not directly correlated with the wind speed, the MLD biases, or the stratification at the ML base. Instead, NIKE biases are sensitive to the vertical mixing scheme parameterization. NIKE biases are lowest when the KPP scheme is used.</jats:p>\n<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Prediction and Research Moored Array in the Tropical Atlantic (PIRATA) is a multinational program initiated in 1997 in the tropical Atlantic to improve our understanding and ability to predict ocean\u2010atmosphere variability.

The radio detection method, utilizing Askaryan emission, can be used to detect these neutrinos in polar ice. The propagation of the radio pulses has to be modeled carefully to reconstruct the energy, direction, and flavor of the neutrino from the detected radio flashes. Here, we study the effect of birefringence in ice, which splits up the radio pulse into two orthogonal polarization components with slightly different propagation speeds. This provides useful signatures to determine the neutrino energy and is potentially important to determine the neutrino direction to degree precision. We calculated the effect of birefringence from first principles where the only free parameter is the dielectric tensor as a function of position. Our code, for the first time, can propagate full RF waveforms, taking interference due to changing polarization eigenvectors during propagation into account. The model is available open-source through the NuRadioMC framework. We compare our results to in-situ calibration data from the ARA and ARIANNA experiments and find good agreement for the available time delay measurements. This indicates a significant improvement of the prediction power of birefringence effects compared to previous models.

Magnetars are neutron stars with strong magnetic fields on the order of 10<jats:sup>15</jats:sup> G with a short decay lifetime of less than 10<jats:sup>4</jats:sup> yr. Due to their extremely short lifetimes, magnetars should follow the demographics of galaxies according to their current star formation rate (SFR). Moreover, we hypothesize that magnetars should follow the SFR profile within galaxies, which we assume to follow an exponential profile. We construct a simple model for the host galaxies of magnetars assuming these events track SFR in all galaxies and compare it to observed properties from a sample of 10 secure FRB hosts. We find the distribution of observed SFRs is inconsistent with the model at &gt;95% c.l. The offset distribution is consistent with this scenario; however, this could be due to the limited sample size and the seeing-limited estimates for the effective radii of the FRB host galaxies. Despite the recent association of an FRB with a magnetar in the Milky Way, magnetars may not be the only source of FRBs in the universe, yet any other successful model must account for the demographics of the FRB host in SFR and their observed galactocentric offsets.</jats:p>\n<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>The H <jats:sc>i</jats:sc> gas content is a key ingredient in galaxy evolution, the study of which has been limited to moderate cosmological distances for individual galaxies due to the weakness of the hyperfine H <jats:sc>i</jats:sc> 21 cm transition.

This bias arises as an effect of the magnitude and colour criteria utilized in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasar target selection up until data release 7 (DR7). The bias has previously been quantified assuming only a contribution from the dust obscuration. In this work, we apply the full set of magnitude and colour criteria used up until SDSS-DR7 in order to quantify the full impact of dust biasing against dusty and metal-rich DLAs. We apply the quasar target selection algorithm on a modelled population of intrinsic colours, and by exploring the parameter space consisting of redshift, ($z_{\\rm{\\small QSO}}$and zabs), optical extinction, and H\u2009i column density, we demonstrate how the selection probability depends on these variables. We quantify the dust bias on the following properties derived for DLAs at z\u00a0\u2248\u00a03: the incidence rate, the mass density of neutral hydrogen and metals, and the average metallicity. We find that all quantities are significantly affected. When considering all uncertainties, the mass density of neutral hydrogen is underestimated by 10\u201350\u00a0per\u2009cent, and the mass density in metals is underestimated by 30\u2013200\u00a0per\u2009cent. Lastly, we find that the bias depends on redshift. At redshift z\u00a0=\u00a02.2, the mass density of neutral hydrogen and metals might be underestimated by up to a factor of 2 and 5, respectively. Characterizing such a bias is crucial in order to accurately interpret and model the properties and metallicity evolution of absorption-selected galaxies.</jats:p>\n<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>One of the most fundamental baryonic matter components of galaxies is the neutral atomic hydrogen (H <jats:sc>i</jats:sc>).

We further use these simulations to make predictions for the total baryonic matter content of galaxies at <jats:italic>z</jats:italic> \u2248 6, and specifically the H <jats:sc>i</jats:sc> gas mass fraction.

Recently, using observations and reanalysis products, the central Indian Ocean (CIO) mode was found to be a natural mode in the ocean\u2010atmosphere coupled system and also shown to have a close mechanistic connection with the monsoon intraseasonal oscillation (MISO). In this study, the simulation of the actual CIO mode in historical Community Earth System Model (CESM) outputs is assessed by comparing with observations and reanalysis products. The simulation of the Madden\u2010Julian Oscillation, a major component of tropical intraseasonal variabilities (ISVs), is satisfactory. However, the CIO mode is not well captured in any of the CESM simulations considered here. The force and response relationship between the atmosphere and the ocean associated with the CIO mode in CESM is opposite to that in nature. The simulated meridional gradient of large\u2010scale zonal winds is too weak, which precludes the necessary energy conversion from the mean state to the ISVs and cuts off the energy source to MISO in CESM. The inability of CESM to reproduce the CIO mode seen clearly in nature highlights the CIO mode as a new dynamical framework for diagnosing the deficiencies in Indian summer monsoon simulation in climate models. The CIO mode is a coupled metric for evaluating climate models and may be a better indicator of a model's skill to accurately capture the tropical multiscale interactions over subseasonal to interannual timescales.</jats:p>\n<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Tropical sea surface temperature (SST) biases can cause atmospheric biases on global scales, hence SST needs to be represented well in climate models. A major source of uncertainties is the representation of turbulent mixing in the oceanic boundary layer, or mixed layer (ML).

The performance of two mixing schemes, Turbulent Kinetic Energy and K\u2010profile parameterization (KPP), is assessed at two sites (11.5\u00b0N, 23\u00b0W and 15\u00b0N, 38\u00b0W) in the tropical Atlantic. At 11.5\u00b0N, turbulence observations (eddy diffusivities, shear and stratification) are available for comparison. We find that the schemes differ in their representation of NIWs, but both under\u2010represent the observed enhanced diffusivities below the observed ML. However, we find that the models do mix below the ML at 15\u00b0N when a storm passes nearby. The near\u2010inertial oscillations remain below the ML for the following 10\u00a0days. Near\u2010inertial kinetic energy (NIKE) biases in the models are not directly correlated with the wind speed, the MLD biases, or the stratification at the ML base. Instead, NIKE biases are sensitive to the vertical mixing scheme parameterization. NIKE biases are lowest when the KPP scheme is used.</jats:p>\n<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Prediction and Research Moored Array in the Tropical Atlantic (PIRATA) is a multinational program initiated in 1997 in the tropical Atlantic to improve our understanding and ability to predict ocean\u2010atmosphere variability.

Magnetars are neutron stars with strong magnetic fields on the order of 10<jats:sup>15</jats:sup> G with a short decay lifetime of less than 10<jats:sup>4</jats:sup> yr. Due to their extremely short lifetimes, magnetars should follow the demographics of galaxies according to their current star formation rate (SFR). Moreover, we hypothesize that magnetars should follow the SFR profile within galaxies, which we assume to follow an exponential profile. We construct a simple model for the host galaxies of magnetars assuming these events track SFR in all galaxies and compare it to observed properties from a sample of 10 secure FRB hosts. We find the distribution of observed SFRs is inconsistent with the model at &gt;95% c.l. The offset distribution is consistent with this scenario; however, this could be due to the limited sample size and the seeing-limited estimates for the effective radii of the FRB host galaxies. Despite the recent association of an FRB with a magnetar in the Milky Way, magnetars may not be the only source of FRBs in the universe, yet any other successful model must account for the demographics of the FRB host in SFR and their observed galactocentric offsets.</jats:p>\n<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>The H <jats:sc>i</jats:sc> gas content is a key ingredient in galaxy evolution, the study of which has been limited to moderate cosmological distances for individual galaxies due to the weakness of the hyperfine H <jats:sc>i</jats:sc> 21 cm transition.

This bias arises as an effect of the magnitude and colour criteria utilized in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasar target selection up until data release 7 (DR7). The bias has previously been quantified assuming only a contribution from the dust obscuration. In this work, we apply the full set of magnitude and colour criteria used up until SDSS-DR7 in order to quantify the full impact of dust biasing against dusty and metal-rich DLAs. We apply the quasar target selection algorithm on a modelled population of intrinsic colours, and by exploring the parameter space consisting of redshift, ($z_{\\rm{\\small QSO}}$and zabs), optical extinction, and H\u2009i column density, we demonstrate how the selection probability depends on these variables. We quantify the dust bias on the following properties derived for DLAs at z\u00a0\u2248\u00a03: the incidence rate, the mass density of neutral hydrogen and metals, and the average metallicity. We find that all quantities are significantly affected. When considering all uncertainties, the mass density of neutral hydrogen is underestimated by 10\u201350\u00a0per\u2009cent, and the mass density in metals is underestimated by 30\u2013200\u00a0per\u2009cent. Lastly, we find that the bias depends on redshift. At redshift z\u00a0=\u00a02.2, the mass density of neutral hydrogen and metals might be underestimated by up to a factor of 2 and 5, respectively. Characterizing such a bias is crucial in order to accurately interpret and model the properties and metallicity evolution of absorption-selected galaxies.</jats:p>\n<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>One of the most fundamental baryonic matter components of galaxies is the neutral atomic hydrogen (H <jats:sc>i</jats:sc>).

Recently, using observations and reanalysis products, the central Indian Ocean (CIO) mode was found to be a natural mode in the ocean\u2010atmosphere coupled system and also shown to have a close mechanistic connection with the monsoon intraseasonal oscillation (MISO). In this study, the simulation of the actual CIO mode in historical Community Earth System Model (CESM) outputs is assessed by comparing with observations and reanalysis products. The simulation of the Madden\u2010Julian Oscillation, a major component of tropical intraseasonal variabilities (ISVs), is satisfactory. However, the CIO mode is not well captured in any of the CESM simulations considered here. The force and response relationship between the atmosphere and the ocean associated with the CIO mode in CESM is opposite to that in nature. The simulated meridional gradient of large\u2010scale zonal winds is too weak, which precludes the necessary energy conversion from the mean state to the ISVs and cuts off the energy source to MISO in CESM. The inability of CESM to reproduce the CIO mode seen clearly in nature highlights the CIO mode as a new dynamical framework for diagnosing the deficiencies in Indian summer monsoon simulation in climate models. The CIO mode is a coupled metric for evaluating climate models and may be a better indicator of a model's skill to accurately capture the tropical multiscale interactions over subseasonal to interannual timescales.</jats:p>\n<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Tropical sea surface temperature (SST) biases can cause atmospheric biases on global scales, hence SST needs to be represented well in climate models. A major source of uncertainties is the representation of turbulent mixing in the oceanic boundary layer, or mixed layer (ML). In the present study we focus on near\u2010inertial wave (NIW) induced mixing. The performance of two mixing schemes, Turbulent Kinetic Energy and K\u2010profile parameterization (KPP), is assessed at two sites (11.5\u00b0N, 23\u00b0W and 15\u00b0N, 38\u00b0W) in the tropical Atlantic. At 11.5\u00b0N, turbulence observations (eddy diffusivities, shear and stratification) are available for comparison. We find that the schemes differ in their representation of NIWs, but both under\u2010represent the observed enhanced diffusivities below the observed ML. However, we find that the models do mix below the ML at 15\u00b0N when a storm passes nearby. The near\u2010inertial oscillations remain below the ML for the following 10\u00a0days. Near\u2010inertial kinetic energy (NIKE) biases in the models are not directly correlated with the wind speed, the MLD biases, or the stratification at the ML base. Instead, NIKE biases are sensitive to the vertical mixing scheme parameterization. NIKE biases are lowest when the KPP scheme is used.</jats:p>\n<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Prediction and Research Moored Array in the Tropical Atlantic (PIRATA) is a multinational program initiated in 1997 in the tropical Atlantic to improve our understanding and ability to predict ocean\u2010atmosphere variability.

Magnetars are neutron stars with strong magnetic fields on the order of 10<jats:sup>15</jats:sup> G with a short decay lifetime of less than 10<jats:sup>4</jats:sup> yr. Due to their extremely short lifetimes, magnetars should follow the demographics of galaxies according to their current star formation rate (SFR). Moreover, we hypothesize that magnetars should follow the SFR profile within galaxies, which we assume to follow an exponential profile. We construct a simple model for the host galaxies of magnetars assuming these events track SFR in all galaxies and compare it to observed properties from a sample of 10 secure FRB hosts. We find the distribution of observed SFRs is inconsistent with the model at &gt;95% c.l. The offset distribution is consistent with this scenario; however, this could be due to the limited sample size and the seeing-limited estimates for the effective radii of the FRB host galaxies. Despite the recent association of an FRB with a magnetar in the Milky Way, magnetars may not be the only source of FRBs in the universe, yet any other successful model must account for the demographics of the FRB host in SFR and their observed galactocentric offsets.</jats:p>\n<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>The H <jats:sc>i</jats:sc> gas content is a key ingredient in galaxy evolution, the study of which has been limited to moderate cosmological distances for individual galaxies due to the weakness of the hyperfine H <jats:sc>i</jats:sc> 21 cm transition.

This bias arises as an effect of the magnitude and colour criteria utilized in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasar target selection up until data release 7 (DR7). The bias has previously been quantified assuming only a contribution from the dust obscuration. In this work, we apply the full set of magnitude and colour criteria used up until SDSS-DR7 in order to quantify the full impact of dust biasing against dusty and metal-rich DLAs. We apply the quasar target selection algorithm on a modelled population of intrinsic colours, and by exploring the parameter space consisting of redshift, ($z_{\\rm{\\small QSO}}$and zabs), optical extinction, and H\u2009i column density, we demonstrate how the selection probability depends on these variables. We quantify the dust bias on the following properties derived for DLAs at z\u00a0\u2248\u00a03: the incidence rate, the mass density of neutral hydrogen and metals, and the average metallicity. We find that all quantities are significantly affected. When considering all uncertainties, the mass density of neutral hydrogen is underestimated by 10\u201350\u00a0per\u2009cent, and the mass density in metals is underestimated by 30\u2013200\u00a0per\u2009cent. Lastly, we find that the bias depends on redshift. At redshift z\u00a0=\u00a02.2, the mass density of neutral hydrogen and metals might be underestimated by up to a factor of 2 and 5, respectively. Characterizing such a bias is crucial in order to accurately interpret and model the properties and metallicity evolution of absorption-selected galaxies.</jats:p>\n<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>One of the most fundamental baryonic matter components of galaxies is the neutral atomic hydrogen (H <jats:sc>i</jats:sc>).

We further use these simulations to make predictions for the total baryonic matter content of galaxies at <jats:italic>z</jats:italic> \u2248 6, and specifically the H <jats:sc>i</jats:sc> gas mass fraction.

Recently, using observations and reanalysis products, the central Indian Ocean (CIO) mode was found to be a natural mode in the ocean\u2010atmosphere coupled system and also shown to have a close mechanistic connection with the monsoon intraseasonal oscillation (MISO). In this study, the simulation of the actual CIO mode in historical Community Earth System Model (CESM) outputs is assessed by comparing with observations and reanalysis products. The simulation of the Madden\u2010Julian Oscillation, a major component of tropical intraseasonal variabilities (ISVs), is satisfactory. However, the CIO mode is not well captured in any of the CESM simulations considered here. The force and response relationship between the atmosphere and the ocean associated with the CIO mode in CESM is opposite to that in nature. The simulated meridional gradient of large\u2010scale zonal winds is too weak, which precludes the necessary energy conversion from the mean state to the ISVs and cuts off the energy source to MISO in CESM. The inability of CESM to reproduce the CIO mode seen clearly in nature highlights the CIO mode as a new dynamical framework for diagnosing the deficiencies in Indian summer monsoon simulation in climate models. The CIO mode is a coupled metric for evaluating climate models and may be a better indicator of a model's skill to accurately capture the tropical multiscale interactions over subseasonal to interannual timescales.</jats:p>\n<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Tropical sea surface temperature (SST) biases can cause atmospheric biases on global scales, hence SST needs to be represented well in climate models.

The performance of two mixing schemes, Turbulent Kinetic Energy and K\u2010profile parameterization (KPP), is assessed at two sites (11.5\u00b0N, 23\u00b0W and 15\u00b0N, 38\u00b0W) in the tropical Atlantic. At 11.5\u00b0N, turbulence observations (eddy diffusivities, shear and stratification) are available for comparison. We find that the schemes differ in their representation of NIWs, but both under\u2010represent the observed enhanced diffusivities below the observed ML. However, we find that the models do mix below the ML at 15\u00b0N when a storm passes nearby. The near\u2010inertial oscillations remain below the ML for the following 10\u00a0days. Near\u2010inertial kinetic energy (NIKE) biases in the models are not directly correlated with the wind speed, the MLD biases, or the stratification at the ML base. Instead, NIKE biases are sensitive to the vertical mixing scheme parameterization. NIKE biases are lowest when the KPP scheme is used.</jats:p>\n<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Prediction and Research Moored Array in the Tropical Atlantic (PIRATA) is a multinational program initiated in 1997 in the tropical Atlantic to improve our understanding and ability to predict ocean\u2010atmosphere variability.

Magnetars are neutron stars with strong magnetic fields on the order of 10<jats:sup>15</jats:sup> G with a short decay lifetime of less than 10<jats:sup>4</jats:sup> yr. Due to their extremely short lifetimes, magnetars should follow the demographics of galaxies according to their current star formation rate (SFR). Moreover, we hypothesize that magnetars should follow the SFR profile within galaxies, which we assume to follow an exponential profile. We construct a simple model for the host galaxies of magnetars assuming these events track SFR in all galaxies and compare it to observed properties from a sample of 10 secure FRB hosts. We find the distribution of observed SFRs is inconsistent with the model at &gt;95% c.l. The offset distribution is consistent with this scenario; however, this could be due to the limited sample size and the seeing-limited estimates for the effective radii of the FRB host galaxies. Despite the recent association of an FRB with a magnetar in the Milky Way, magnetars may not be the only source of FRBs in the universe, yet any other successful model must account for the demographics of the FRB host in SFR and their observed galactocentric offsets.</jats:p>\n<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>The H <jats:sc>i</jats:sc> gas content is a key ingredient in galaxy evolution, the study of which has been limited to moderate cosmological distances for individual galaxies due to the weakness of the hyperfine H <jats:sc>i</jats:sc> 21 cm transition.

The H <jats:sc>i</jats:sc> fraction of the total baryonic mass increases from around 20% at <jats:italic>z</jats:italic> = 0 to about 60% at <jats:italic>z</jats:italic> \u223c 6.

This bias arises as an effect of the magnitude and colour criteria utilized in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasar target selection up until data release 7 (DR7). The bias has previously been quantified assuming only a contribution from the dust obscuration. In this work, we apply the full set of magnitude and colour criteria used up until SDSS-DR7 in order to quantify the full impact of dust biasing against dusty and metal-rich DLAs. We apply the quasar target selection algorithm on a modelled population of intrinsic colours, and by exploring the parameter space consisting of redshift, ($z_{\\rm{\\small QSO}}$and zabs), optical extinction, and H\u2009i column density, we demonstrate how the selection probability depends on these variables. We quantify the dust bias on the following properties derived for DLAs at z\u00a0\u2248\u00a03: the incidence rate, the mass density of neutral hydrogen and metals, and the average metallicity. We find that all quantities are significantly affected. When considering all uncertainties, the mass density of neutral hydrogen is underestimated by 10\u201350\u00a0per\u2009cent, and the mass density in metals is underestimated by 30\u2013200\u00a0per\u2009cent. Lastly, we find that the bias depends on redshift. At redshift z\u00a0=\u00a02.2, the mass density of neutral hydrogen and metals might be underestimated by up to a factor of 2 and 5, respectively. Characterizing such a bias is crucial in order to accurately interpret and model the properties and metallicity evolution of absorption-selected galaxies.</jats:p>\n<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>One of the most fundamental baryonic matter components of galaxies is the neutral atomic hydrogen (H <jats:sc>i</jats:sc>).

We select 11,125 star-forming galaxies from the <jats:sc>simba</jats:sc> simulations, with far-infrared line emissions postprocessed and modeled within the S<jats:sc>igame</jats:sc> framework. We find a strong connection between C <jats:sc>ii</jats:sc> and H <jats:sc>i</jats:sc>, with the relation between this C <jats:sc>ii</jats:sc>-to-H <jats:sc>i</jats:sc> relation (<jats:italic>\u03b2</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:sub>[C <jats:sc>II</jats:sc>]</jats:sub>) being anticorrelated with the gas-phase metallicity of the simulated galaxies. We further use these simulations to make predictions for the total baryonic matter content of galaxies at <jats:italic>z</jats:italic> \u2248 6, and specifically the H <jats:sc>i</jats:sc> gas mass fraction.

Recently, using observations and reanalysis products, the central Indian Ocean (CIO) mode was found to be a natural mode in the ocean\u2010atmosphere coupled system and also shown to have a close mechanistic connection with the monsoon intraseasonal oscillation (MISO). In this study, the simulation of the actual CIO mode in historical Community Earth System Model (CESM) outputs is assessed by comparing with observations and reanalysis products. The simulation of the Madden\u2010Julian Oscillation, a major component of tropical intraseasonal variabilities (ISVs), is satisfactory. However, the CIO mode is not well captured in any of the CESM simulations considered here. The force and response relationship between the atmosphere and the ocean associated with the CIO mode in CESM is opposite to that in nature. The simulated meridional gradient of large\u2010scale zonal winds is too weak, which precludes the necessary energy conversion from the mean state to the ISVs and cuts off the energy source to MISO in CESM. The inability of CESM to reproduce the CIO mode seen clearly in nature highlights the CIO mode as a new dynamical framework for diagnosing the deficiencies in Indian summer monsoon simulation in climate models.

However, we find that the models do mix below the ML at 15\u00b0N when a storm passes nearby. The near\u2010inertial oscillations remain below the ML for the following 10\u00a0days. Near\u2010inertial kinetic energy (NIKE) biases in the models are not directly correlated with the wind speed, the MLD biases, or the stratification at the ML base.

Recently, using observations and reanalysis products, the central Indian Ocean (CIO) mode was found to be a natural mode in the ocean\u2010atmosphere coupled system and also shown to have a close mechanistic connection with the monsoon intraseasonal oscillation (MISO). In this study, the simulation of the actual CIO mode in historical Community Earth System Model (CESM) outputs is assessed by comparing with observations and reanalysis products. The simulation of the Madden\u2010Julian Oscillation, a major component of tropical intraseasonal variabilities (ISVs), is satisfactory. However, the CIO mode is not well captured in any of the CESM simulations considered here. The force and response relationship between the atmosphere and the ocean associated with the CIO mode in CESM is opposite to that in nature. The simulated meridional gradient of large\u2010scale zonal winds is too weak, which precludes the necessary energy conversion from the mean state to the ISVs and cuts off the energy source to MISO in CESM. The inability of CESM to reproduce the CIO mode seen clearly in nature highlights the CIO mode as a new dynamical framework for diagnosing the deficiencies in Indian summer monsoon simulation in climate models. The CIO mode is a coupled metric for evaluating climate models and may be a better indicator of a model's skill to accurately capture the tropical multiscale interactions over subseasonal to interannual timescales.</jats:p>\n<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Tropical sea surface temperature (SST) biases can cause atmospheric biases on global scales, hence SST needs to be represented well in climate models. A major source of uncertainties is the representation of turbulent mixing in the oceanic boundary layer, or mixed layer (ML). In the present study we focus on near\u2010inertial wave (NIW) induced mixing. The performance of two mixing schemes, Turbulent Kinetic Energy and K\u2010profile parameterization (KPP), is assessed at two sites (11.5\u00b0N, 23\u00b0W and 15\u00b0N, 38\u00b0W) in the tropical Atlantic. At 11.5\u00b0N, turbulence observations (eddy diffusivities, shear and stratification) are available for comparison. We find that the schemes differ in their representation of NIWs, but both under\u2010represent the observed enhanced diffusivities below the observed ML. However, we find that the models do mix below the ML at 15\u00b0N when a storm passes nearby. The near\u2010inertial oscillations remain below the ML for the following 10\u00a0days. Near\u2010inertial kinetic energy (NIKE) biases in the models are not directly correlated with the wind speed, the MLD biases, or the stratification at the ML base. Instead, NIKE biases are sensitive to the vertical mixing scheme parameterization. NIKE biases are lowest when the KPP scheme is used.</jats:p>\n<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Prediction and Research Moored Array in the Tropical Atlantic (PIRATA) is a multinational program initiated in 1997 in the tropical Atlantic to improve our understanding and ability to predict ocean\u2010atmosphere variability.
