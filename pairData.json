This review focuses on a number of key issues of relevance for the characterization, performance and implementation of such materials in actual devices. The phenomenology and fundamental thermodynamics of magnetocaloric materials is discussed, as well as the hysteresis behavior often found in first\u2010order materials. A number of theoretical and experimental approaches and their implications are reviewed. The question of how to evaluate the suitability of a given material for use in a magnetocaloric device is covered in some detail, including a critical assessment of a number of common performance metrics. Of particular interest is which non\u2010magnetocaloric properties need to be considered in this connection. An \u2026\n\nTitle: The performance of a combined solar photovoltaic (PV) and thermoelectric generator (TEG) system\nAbstract: The performance of a combined solar photovoltaic (PV) and thermoelectric generator (TEG) system is examined using an analytical model for four different types of commercial PVs and a commercial bismuth telluride TEG. The TEG is applied directly on the back of the PV, so that the two devices have the same temperature. The PVs considered are crystalline Si (c-Si), amorphous Si (a-Si), copper indium gallium (di) selenide (CIGS) and cadmium telluride (CdTe) cells. The degradation of PV performance with temperature is shown to dominate the increase in power produced by the TEG, due to the low efficiency of the TEG. For c-Si, CIGS and CdTe PV cells the combined system produces a lower power and has a lower efficiency than the PV alone, whereas for an a-Si cell the total system performance may be slightly increased by the TEG.\n\nTitle: Review and comparison of magnet designs for magnetic refrigeration\nAbstract: One of the key issues in magnetic refrigeration is generating the magnetic field that the magnetocaloric material must be subjected to. The magnet constitutes a major part of the expense of a complete magnetic refrigeration system and a large effort should therefore be invested in improving the magnet design. A detailed analysis of the efficiency of different published permanent magnet designs used in magnetic refrigeration applications is presented in this paper. Each design is analyzed based on the generated magnetic flux density, the volume of the region where this flux is generated and the amount of magnet material used. This is done by characterizing each design by a figure of merit magnet design efficiency parameter, \u039bcool. The designs are then compared and the best design found. Finally recommendations for designing the ideal magnet design are presented based on the analysis of the reviewed designs.\n\nTitle: Experimental results for a novel rotary active magnetic regenerator\nAbstract: Active magnetic regenerator (AMR) refrigerators represent an alternative to vapor compression technology and have great potential in realizing cooling devices with high efficiency, which are highly desirable for a broad range of applications. The technology relies on the magnetocaloric effect in a solid refrigerant rather than the temperature change that occurs when a gas is compressed/expanded. This paper presents the general considerations for the design and construction of a high frequency rotary AMR device. Experimental results are presented at various cooling powers for a range of operating conditions near room temperature. The device exhibited a no-load temperature span of over 25 K and can absorb a 100 W cooling load at a 20.5 K temperature span.\n\nTitle: Magnetocaloric properties of LaFe13\u2212 x\u2212 yCoxSiy and commercial grade Gd\nAbstract: The magnetocaloric properties of three samples of LaFe13\u2212x\u2212yCoxSiy have been measured and compared to measurements of commercial grade Gd. The samples have (x=0.86, y=1.08), (x=0.94, y=1.01) and (x=0.97, y=1.07) yielding Curie temperatures in the range 276\u2013288K. The magnetization, specific heat capacity and adiabatic temperature change have been measured over a broad temperature interval. Importantly, all measurements were corrected for demagnetization, allowing the data to be directly compared. In an internal field of 1T the maximum specific entropy changes were 6.2, 5.1 and 5.0J/kgK, the specific heat capacities were 910, 840 and 835J/kgK and the adiabatic temperature changes were 2.3, 2.1 and 2.1K for the three LaFeCoSi samples respectively. For Gd in an internal field of 1T the maximum specific entropy change was 3.1J/kgK, the specific heat capacity was 340J/kgK and the adiabatic \u2026", "discussion_points": ["1. **Interdisciplinary Applications of ML**:", "   - Evangelia, given your experience with CNNs and untrained neural networks in quantum physics, and Rasmus, considering your interest in CNNs and generative models, how do you both envision machine learning advancing your respective fields?
